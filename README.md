## Connect Health Patient Portal Next.js Application

###  Serving the Application on your Local Machine

If you don’t have Node.js installed, install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). You’ll need Node.js version 10.13 or later.

Using the command line, `cd` into the application's directory and run the following command:

    npm install

followed by:

    npm run dev

These commands install the dependencies needed to run the application and also  start a development server accessible on port 3000. The application will now be accessible using your browser at http://localhost:3000.
